# CSCI 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab
In this lab you will learn to create a simple website using HTML and CSS, following best practices
and using validated code, all while maintaining good version control.

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md) file in this repository.

## Setup Instructions:
Clone your repository to your local working environment.

## "Running" your project
To view your website, you should be able to simply open the ``index.html`` file in your browser of choice.
(In most cases, 'double clicking' the file should do this)

#### Version Control Reminder:
Remember to practice good version control! New features should be developed in
feature branches, [commit messages should be in the present tense and provide
meaningful information](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), 
and you should use pull requests on github to merge
changes from feature branches into your master branch.
