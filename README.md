# CSCI 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab
In this lab you will learn to create a simple website using HTML and CSS, following best practices
and using validated code, all while maintaining good version control using WebStorm's git/GitHub integration.  

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md) file in this repository.

## Setup Instructions:

#### Checking out your project in WebStorm:
1. In the WebStorm launch window, choose "Check out from version control", choose GitHub.
2. You will be asked to enter your GitHub login information, as well as a master password (used to store login information locally).
3. Select your repository from the drop down menu ("Git repository URL"). If your repo is not listed here, you can copy-paste this address from GitHub. 


#### Version Control Reminder:
Remember to practice good version control! New features should be developed in
feature branches, commit messages should be in the present tense and provide
meaningful information, and you should use pull requests on github to merge
changes from feature branches into your master branch.
