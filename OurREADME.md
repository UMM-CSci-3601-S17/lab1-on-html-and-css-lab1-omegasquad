~HTML5 Features~
----------------
<figure> & <figcaption> : From what I came across when looking up HTML5 features, we couldve used <aside> instead, but that element
                            is typically used when the content doesn't have much relation to the content of the page. We decided to go with
                            <figure> and with a nested <figcaption> since the images for the puppies match the page content.

~CSS3 Features~
---------------
Backgrounds & Boarders: we used this feature because we thought it would be a good idea to surround the  header of each section
                        with a dog bone. We also though placing puppies around the header of the website would really show
                        at first glance that the customer should expect to see a lot of puppies since that's what the business
                        is all about.
